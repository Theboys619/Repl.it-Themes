## Repl.it Themes

This is a chrome extension for repl.it/chrome.
The extension lets you create custom themes for repl.it or use existing ones predefined in the extension.

This is still in very early development and probably has a *bit* of bugs. So please keep that in mind and use at your own risk (you can uninstall too).

I created this yesterday (Aug 29, 2020) because I remembered a post that someone made about themes for repl.it (srry I don't remember who).

### Installation

To install the extension please read the README.md file on the github or in the repl and download the contents.

### What it looks like

Here is a little preview of what it looks like on repl.

This is the Solarized Dark theme from VSCode in Repl.it!

Not only does it have *some* (not all are working) VSCode themes but you can even define your own.
In order to define your own theme you have to use Monaco's JSON themes.

Test your themes in the playground and them stringify the JSON or it wont work.

You only need the JSON part of the code and it **NEEDS** to be stringified.

### Selecting a theme

To select a theme you have to click on the extension and go the the options page.
You can do that by what I said earlier (clicking on the extension) or going to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) and finding the extension and clicking the inspect views link.

You then can select a theme from the drop down list and your are ready to go.
Just refresh your repl.it page or go to one of your projects and it should load.

The styling isn't the best mainly because I wanted this to actually work first.

Please drop some suggestions or message me with possible bugs that I have not found yet.
